## About <a name="About"></a>

### How to play <a name="HowToPlay"></a>
1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

2. Player 1 is X, Player 2 is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

3. The first player to get 3 of his marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

5. Travel Time option: Players can go back in time to the previous moves in the game by clicking on the buttons on the right side of the screen.
